# Credence Backend

API and services for the Credence economic trust protocol. Provides health checks, trust score and bond status endpoints (to be wired to Horizon and a reputation engine).

## About

This service is part of [Credence](../README.md). It will support:

- Public query API (trust score, bond status, attestations)
- Horizon listener for bond/slash events (future)
- Reputation engine (off-chain score from bond data) (future)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Required for production operations:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (starts the DB pool, enables health check).
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string (enables caching and health check).
- `RPC_URL`: JSON-RPC endpoint for blockchain (e.g. Alchemy, Infura).
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Deployed attestation contract address on the target chain.

## Run locally

**Development (watch mode):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

API runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The frontend proxies `/api` to this URL.

## Scripts

| Command              | Description              |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `npm run dev`        | Start with tsx watch     |
| `npm run build`      | Compile TypeScript       |
| `npm start`          | Run compiled `dist/`     |
| `npm run lint`       | Run ESLint               |
| `npm test`           | Run tests                |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage |

## API (current)

| Method | Path               | Description        |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| GET    | `/api/health`      | Health check (readiness + dependency status) |
| GET    | `/api/health/ready`| Readiness (same as `/api/health`) |
| GET    | `/api/health/live` | Liveness (process up; always 200) |
| GET    | `/api/trust/:address` | Trust score (stub) |
| GET    | `/api/bond/:address`   | Bond status (stub) |

### Health endpoint (detailed)

The health API reports status per dependency (database, Redis, optional external) without exposing internal details.

- **Readiness** (`GET /api/health` or `GET /api/health/ready`): Returns `200` when all *configured* critical dependencies (DB, Redis) are up; returns `503` if any critical dependency is down. When `DATABASE_URL` or `REDIS_URL` are not set, those dependencies are reported as `not_configured` and do not cause `503`.
- **Liveness** (`GET /api/health/live`): Returns `200` when the process is running (no dependency checks). Use for Kubernetes/orchestrator liveness probes.

Response shape (readiness):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "credence-backend",
  "dependencies": {
    "db": { "status": "up" },
    "redis": { "status": "up" }
  }
}
```

`status` may be `ok`, `degraded` (optional external down), or `unhealthy` (critical dependency down). Each dependency `status` is `up`, `down`, or `not_configured`. Optional env: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` to enable DB and Redis checks.

### Testing

Health endpoints are covered by unit and route tests. Run:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

Scenarios covered: all dependencies up, DB down (503), Redis down (503), both down (503), only external down (200 degraded), liveness always 200, and no dependencies configured (200 ok).

## Background Services

### Attestation Event Listener
When `RPC_URL` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` are provided via environment variables, the backend automatically starts an `ethers` event listener in the background. It listens to the contract for `Attested` and `Revoked` events. 

- **Upserts**: Attestations are synced natively to the PostgreSQL `attestations` table handling conflicts properly to avoid erroring on duplicate data.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Triggers a cache purge for the user's reputation score via Redis.

## Tech

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express
- PostgreSQL (`pg`)
- Redis (`ioredis`)
- Ethers.js (`ethers`)
